Validate that the necessary columns (Student ID, Name, Subject, Score) are present. Handle missing or invalid data by filling or discarding incomplete rows.

2. Aggregating Data:
Group the data by Student ID and Name to compute each student's total and average scores.
Extract subject-wise scores for individual students for detailed reporting.

3. Generating PDF Report Cards:
Use the ReportLab library to create PDF files.
Each report includes:
  The studentâ€™s name.
  Their total score and average score.
  A table displaying their subject-wise scores.
Apply styling to the table for better readability.

4. Saving PDF Files:
Name each file using the format report_card_<StudentID>.pdf and save it in the working directory.

5. Error Handling:
Include error handling for file-related issues (e.g., missing file), missing columns, or unexpected data formats.
